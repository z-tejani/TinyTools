# Uptime Checker

A simple tool that takes a list of websites from a file (default `urls.txt`), pings each one, and reports if any are down.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `requests` (`pip install requests`)

## Usage

1. Create a `urls.txt` file with one URL per line.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python3 uptime.py [file_path]
```
